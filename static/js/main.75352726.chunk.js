I will be sharing about books and software engineer here. I am still a newbie in many things around software engineer that is why I would like to invite you to have a slack group for us to discuss software engineer, you can share information or ask questions. This group will be focusing on five aspects (Frontend, Backend, Mobile Development, Data Structures and Algorithm, System Design).

From my own personal problem, I have a very close mentor who already experienced in programming for almost four years. Still, there are many things he doesn't know about because the stack he uses is different from my questions. Also, I am more comfortable asking a person if I know him very well, or else I would better ask in a forum such as slack group."))))}}]),n}(u.a.Component)),f=n(12);n.n(f).a.render(u.a.createElement(h,null),document.querySelector("#root"))}},[[15,1,2]]]);
